# Weather-Dashboard

## Description:

    This application can be used to view the current weather of a given town or region.

    Weather data for the current time is displayed as well as a five day forecast.

    The UV index indicator will change colors depending on the severity of harmful UV rays.

    Recent searches are saved to Local Storage and can be clicked to view the weather data of that
    location again.
    
    If a search is invalid, you will receive a message notifying you and the search will not be added to
    recent searches.

*Note: Only unique searches are saved. If the location already exists in recent searches, it will not be added again. A max of ten recent searches can be saved.*
